### Brave Browser

#### Google dominance

It is a well-known observation that Google is omnipresent. With over 92% in search engine market share and over 65% in web browser space as of August 2021.

The pervasiveness of google search, Chrome, Android OS, and youtube suite of products has given Google unrivaled power to target you with ads based on your online activity individually.

For people bothered by this power of Google's power and reach, with this post, I will discuss the Brave Browser as viable alternate to Google Chrome. Switching to these will help you reduce your Google footprint while also increasing your privacy and security.


#### HERE COMES BRAVE BROWSER

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is a modern, privacy-focussed web browser based on the same [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src
) browser and [Blink](https://www.chromium.org/blink
) rendering engine that powers Google Chrome.
Brave browser is [open source](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser) and is developed by [Brave Software](https://github.com/brave
), co-founded by Brendon Eich, the creator of [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript
) and co-founder of [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla
), the organization that makes [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).

Some of the notable privacy and security features of Brave:

* Automatically blocks unwanted content, such as tracking cookies and 3rd-party ads.
* Automatically protects against [fingerprinting](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protections).
* Where possible, insecure connections like http are converted to https.
* Proper private browsing mode via the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/
) anonymity network. (Though I won't rely on it much and would likely prefer [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) instead)

Similarities of Brave to Chrome:

* Equivalent appearance and feel.
* Multi-platform support, including all primary desktop and mobile platforms
* Cross-platform and cross-device synchronization
* Compatibility with all extensions in the Chrome Store

Notable Brave deviations from Chrome:

* Google account synchronization is disabled
* All features that send data to Google are disabled
* Client-side cookie lifetimes are limited to 7 days


Whilst some privacy-focused characteristics of Brave listed above are available as browser extensions to Chrome, namely the uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere extensions, be aware that not all versions of Chrome support extensions, most frustratingly Chrome on mobile devices. Also, content-filtering extensions, such as uBlock, run the risk of being black-listed by Google one day. That will never be an issue for Brave since its security and privacy protections are built-in to the browser itself.


*__Note__* There are other Chromium-based browsers options, like [Opera](https://www.opera.com/
), [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium), and now even [Microsoft's Edge browser](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us). I favor Brave above all these alternatives due to its open-source development, native privacy, security features, timely updates, cross-platform support and synchronization, and its resemblance to Chrome.

#### Conclusion

The Web is now dominated by a few giant companies, chief among them Google. That market concentration is not healthy, so it benefits us to diversify where possible sensibly. Thankfully, with Brave and DuckDuckGo, alternatives to Chrome and Google Search, respectively, diversifying will incur little compromise while obtaining actual dividends, especially regarding privacy.
The more people that use product like Brave, the healthier the Web will be.
