This is my first blog and i will try to keep it simple and easy to understand. In this blog I am going to talk about what are alias and what is the use of them.

### What is a Alias and Why use them 
Alias are like shortened version of a command than can be used instead of typing-out the whole command. These are quite helpful if you have some common commands that you use on a regualar basis. The alias concept is not something that is particular to bash but can used by different shells like zsh, fish but there is a little difference in syntax. Here I will be giving some examples that are written for bash shell.
